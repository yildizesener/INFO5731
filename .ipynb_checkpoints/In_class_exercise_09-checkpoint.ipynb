    "The purpose of the exercise is to practice different machine learning algorithms for text classification as well as the performance evaluation. In addition, you are requried to conduct *10 fold cross validation (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)* in the training. \n",

The dataset contains two files train data and test data for sentiment analysis in IMDB review, it has two categories: 1 represents positive and 0 represents negative. You need to split the training data into training and validate data (80% for training and 20% for validation, https://towardsdatascience.com/train-test-split-and-cross-validation-in-python-80b61beca4b6) and perform 10 fold cross validation while training the classifier. The final trained model was final evaluated on the test data. \n",
